"""
    This is a programme that translate normal numerals into Roman numerals.
    The rules of Roman numerals are as follow: There are 7 symbols used in Roman Numerals:
    I = 1; V = 5; X = 10; L = 50; C = 100; D = 500; M = 1000
    The way Roman numeral works is to add number from left to right in descending order.
    This means that the biggest numbers sit on the right and descend to the left.
    Numbers that are smaller which stands before the bigger number is substracted from the larger one:
        ie. IV = 5 - 1 = 4.
    This, however, only applies to two of the closest numbers: IV and IX are correct but not IL
        ie. XL and XC is correct; CD and CM is correct.
    Thus, what this means is that the subtraction case only happens for 4, 9 and its 10x
    The current programme only support numbers less than 2000
